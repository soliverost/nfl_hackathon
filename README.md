# NFL Hackathon February 2016
## Mobolity Stats - Because movement is everything
We focused on creating new stats based on movement of the players during the game.

### Fatigue Score 
Based on how much a players move we calculate a fatigue index and provide substitution options.

### Sprint Factor
Measures the speed of the players when they are sprinting along with how long they spent sprinting during the total duration of the game.
